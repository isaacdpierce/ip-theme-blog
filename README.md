  The Portfolio of Isaac Pierce
</h1>

I'm interested in ideas and possibilities, logical reasoning, and complex problem-solving. I respect systems and strategy while being open to spontaneity and rebellion. I'm a grounded dreamer and ferociously independent.

I strive to improve myself and the systems I work within. My analytical skills are most rewarding when used to help others. I look for ways to be helpful to others while maintaining the determination to achieve my own goals.

I enjoy my comfort zones and push myself to experience new things. I respect traditional values while remaining open to new and better ways. I lean on trusted and proven methods while expecting innovation and evolution.
